				<div class="Lethe-meaning">
					<h3> <strong>Lethe</strong> (pronounced /ˈliːθiː/) is an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discrete element method (DEM) and coupled CFD-DEM software which uses high-order continuous Galerkin formulations to simulate single and multiphase flows.</h3>

					<br>

					<p>	Lethe contains a family of solvers that are based on <a href="https://www.dealii.org/" target="_blank">deal.II</a>, a finite element library.
						Through deal.II, Lethe uses <a href="https://trilinos.github.io/ " target="_blank">Trilinos</a>, for its sparse linear algebra routines and <a href="https://www.p4est.org/" target="_blank">p4est</a> for its distributed adaptative quadtrees and octrees.
						Lethe is named after the river of forgetfulness, which, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>: </p>

					<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe">
							<p>is one of the five rivers of the Greek underworld[,] the other four [being] Acheron (the river of sorrow), Cocytus (the river of lamentation), Phlegethon (the river of fire) and Styx (the river that separates Earth and the Underworld). […] The shades of the dead were required to drink the waters of the Lethe in order to forget their earthly life.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>Lethe is described <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100579" target="_blank">here</a>. It originally began as a weekend project, but slowly grew into a robust and efficient CFD, DEM and CFD-DEM software. Lethe is under active development.</p>

					<br>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Lethe would not exist without the dedicated work of the deal.II authors. The authors of Lethe would like to emphasize that without deal.II, dedicated solvers like Lethe could not exist.</p>
