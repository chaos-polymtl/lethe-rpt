Applications Overview
######################

Lethe has several applications that can be used depending on the problem to be solved. Once Lethe is compiled, all the executables to these applications become available. In the following table, we provide a brief description of each application. The applications are sorted from the most commonly used to the least.

     - Physics
     - Description
   * - ``lethe-rpt-3d``
     - * Radioactive Particle Tracking
     - This application solves the Beam Monte-Carlo model for the interaction between gamma ray emitting particles and detectors.
   * - ``lethe-rpt-cell-reconstruction-3d``
     - * Radioactive Particle Tracking
     - This application reconstructs the position of particles using a cellular decomposition approach.
   * - ``lethe-rpt-fem-reconstruction-3d``
     - * Radioactive Particle Tracking
     - This application allows to reconstruct positions from ray tracing experimental measurements obtained by Radioactive Particle Tracking.
   * - ``lethe-rpt-l2-projection-3d``
     - * Radioactive Particle Tracking
     - This application calculates a volumetric projection of the Beam model on a finite element mesh using an L2 projection.
